abstract: 'Chaffing and winnowing, conceived by Ronald Rivest (1998), is a technique that allows to provide data confidentiality over an insecure channel without using encryption. The term winnowing – suggested by Ronald Rivest’s father – means “to separate out or eliminate the poor or useless parts,” while the term chaff is used to identify “useless parts of wheat.” The technique was proposed as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how to achieve data confidentiality without involving encryption or steganography while at the same time preventing an adversary from collecting sensitive data (Katz and Lindell, 2014).'
