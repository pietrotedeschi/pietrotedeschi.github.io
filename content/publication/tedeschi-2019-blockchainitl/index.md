abstract: 'Blockchain is emerging as a promising technology that is able to support transparent, secure, and immutable transactions traceability in decentralized networks. Its usage in many application domains, including the Internet of Things, is gaining the attention of even more researchers and industries worldwide. In line with current research interests, the work presented in this letter has been carried out in the context of the European H2020 symbIoTe project. Among its main features, the symbIoTe framework offers bartering functionalities across a federation of Internet of Things platforms. This letter extends the baseline implementation of bartering functionalities and formulates a novel methodology that properly integrates and takes advantages from the Blockchain technology. Even if the proposed approach is general, the main facets characterizing the conceived approach are illustrated through a fictional use case envisaging the provisioning of Intelligent Transportation System and air pollution services in a Smart City.'
