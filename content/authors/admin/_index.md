I am currently a Senior Security Researcher at [Technology Innovation Institute](https://www.tii.ae/), ex Security Researcher at [Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni](https://www.cnit.it/en/). My major research interests include Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Security, Maritime Security, Wireless Security, Internet of Things (IoT), Applied Cryptography, Privacy Preserving Systems, and Cyber-Physical Systems Security.

I got both my Bachelor and my Master's Degree (with honors) in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Bari, Italy, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Doha, Qatar.

During my Bachelor's Thesis, advised by [Gennaro Boggia](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=uKhe8rkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), I came up with a lightweight key agreement protocol for constrained IoT devices in IEEE 802.15.4e networks by adopting the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) protocol and the implicit certificates ECQV.

During my Master's thesis, advised by [Luigi Alfredo Grieco](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=HmBQd8IAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), I designed and implemented a security framework for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in Horizon 2020 BONVOYAGE project by leveraging the Attribute Based Encryption.

My Ph.D., advised by [Roberto Di Pietro](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=Io9QeG0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), allowed me to design and developing of (i) a dead-reckoning system that leverages the jamming signal to estimate the jammer location; (ii) a privacy-preserving, distributed, and lightweight solution for co-location detection and collision avoidance of autonomous UAVs, and (iii) an anonymous remote identification system for UAVs to allow them to broadcast RemoteID-compliant messages using ephemeral pseudonyms.

During my Ph.D., 12 papers published to international journals, 7 papers published to international conferences, 1 contribution for the Encyclopedia of Cryptography, Security and Privacy, and 4 patents have been produced.
